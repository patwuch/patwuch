I am a data scientist specialising in biology and biomedical applications of data-driven discovery methods, e.g. bioinformatics, biostatistics, or machine learning for epidemiology.

Currently I am affiliated with Taipei Medical University, working on:

### 🦟Department of Molecular Parasitology and Tropical Diseases
Dengue fever epidemiology modelling via machine learning by leveraging Earth Observation(EO) indices, infection trends, vector biology, and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways climate/social projection data

### 🦠Core Laboratory of Human Microbiome
Human microbiota metagenomics and related technologies (transcriptomics, metabolomics...etc)

### Feel free to reach out for any potential collaboration in fields such as: 
1) Omics Application in Immunology or Enterology
2) Geospatial Data Analysis
3) Machine Learning/Deep Learning
4) Multimodal natural language processing
